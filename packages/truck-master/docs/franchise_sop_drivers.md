## Common Issues

### Issue: DL Expired
**Solution**: Request driver to renew DL before verification

**Solution**: Verify actual DL class, update driver profile if needed

### Issue: Driver Not Present
**Solution**: Reschedule verification, notify operator

### Issue: Documents Missing
**Solution**: Request missing documents, mark as PENDING

## Escalation

If verification fails or issues found:
1. Document reason in notes
2. Mark status as REJECTED or PENDING
3. Notify operator
4. Create ticket if serious issues found

## Quality Assurance
