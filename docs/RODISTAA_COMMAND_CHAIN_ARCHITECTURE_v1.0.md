## 🏛️ SECTION 1 — THE CORE COMMAND PYRAMID

Rodistaa's authority structure is **hierarchical and non-negotiable**:

```
                Managing Director (Rodistaa)
                           │
                           ▼
                     HQ Admin / Compliance
                           │
                           ▼
                   District Franchise Head
                           │
                           ▼
                    Unit Franchise Manager
                           │
                           ▼
             Operators → Drivers → Shipments
                           │
                           ▼
