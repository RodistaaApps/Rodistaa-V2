## 🏆 KEY DIFFERENTIATORS IMPLEMENTED

### **1. Win-Based Fee Model** ⭐

```
Not just lowest price, but balanced scoring:
- ETA (40%): Fastest delivery
- Price (35%): Competitive pricing  
- Reliability (25%): Track record

Prevents race-to-bottom, rewards quality operators
```

### **3. Real-Time GPS Tracking** ⭐

60-second automatic updates
Privacy-first: Only during active trips
Geofencing: Automatic arrival alerts
Route history: Permanent storage
